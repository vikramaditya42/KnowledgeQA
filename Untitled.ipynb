Renewable\\nenergy technologies turn these fuels into\\nusable forms of energy—most often elec-\\ntricity, but also heat, chemicals, or\\nmechanical power.\\nWhy Use Renewable Energy?\\nToday we primarily use fossil fuels to heat\\nand power our homes and fuel our cars.\\nIt’s convenient to use coal, oil, and natural\\ngas for meeting our energy needs, but we\\nhave a limited supply of these fuels on the\\nEarth. We’re using them much more\\nrapidly than they are being created. Even-\\ntually, they will run out. And because of \\nsafety concerns and waste disposal prob-\\nlems, the United States will retire much of\\nits nuclear capacity by 2020. In the mean-\\ntime, the nation’s energy needs are\\nexpected to grow by 33 percent during the\\nnext 20 years. Renewable energy can help\\nfill the gap.\\nEven if we had an unlimited supply of fos-\\nsil fuels, using renewable energy is better\\nfor the environment. We often call renew-\\nable energy technologies “clean” or\\n“green” because they produce few if any\\npollutants. Burning fossil fuels, however,\\nsends greenhouse gases into the atmos-\\nphere, trapping the sun’s heat and con-\\ntributing to global warming. Climate\\nscientists generally agree that the Earth’s\\naverage temperature has risen in the past\\ncentury. If this trend continues, sea levels \\nwill rise, and scientists\\npredict that floods,\\nheat waves, droughts,\\nand other extreme\\nweather conditions\\ncould occur more often.\\nOther pollutants are\\nreleased into the air,\\nsoil, and water when\\nfossil fuels are burned.\\nThese pollutants take a\\ndramatic toll on the\\nenvironment—and on\\nhumans.

The United States imports more than\\n50 percent of its oil, up from 34 percent in\\n1973. Replacing some of our petroleum\\nwith fuels made from plant matter, for\\nexample, could save money and\\nstrengthen our energy security.\\nRenewable energy is plentiful, and the\\ntechnologies are improving all the time.\\nThere are many ways to use renewable\\nenergy. Most of us already use renewable\\nenergy in our daily lives.\\nHydropower\\nHydropower is our most mature and\\nlargest source of renewable power, pro-\\nducing about 10 percent of the nation’s\\nelectricity. Existing hydropower capacity\\nis about 77,000 megawatts (MW). Hydro-\\npower plants convert the energy in flowing\\nwater into electricity. The most common\\nform of hydropower uses a dam on a river\\nto retain a large reservoir of water. Water is\\nreleased through turbines to generate\\npower. “Run of the river” systems, how-\\never, divert water from the river and\\ndirect it through a pipeline to a turbine.\\nHydropower plants produce no air emis-\\nsions but can affect water quality and\\nwildlife habitats. Therefore, hydropower\\nplants are now being designed and oper-\\nated to minimize impacts on the river.\\nSome of them are diverting a portion of\\nthe flow around their dams to mimic the\\nnatural flow of the river. But while this\\nimproves the\\nwildlife’s river\\nhabitat, it also\\nreduces the power\\nplant’s output. In\\naddition, fish lad-\\nders and other\\napproaches, such\\nas improved tur-\\nbines, are being\\nused to assist fish\\nwith migration\\nand lower the\\nnumber of fish\\nkilled. \\nBioenergy \\nBioenergy is the energy derived from bio-\\nmass (organic matter), such as plants. If\\nyou’ve ever burned wood in a fireplace or\\ncampfire, you’ve used bioenergy. But we\\ndon’t get all of our biomass resources\\ndirectly from trees or other plants. Many\\nindustries, such as those involved in con-\\nstruction or the processing of agricultural\\nproducts, can create large quantities of\\nunused or residual biomass, which can\\nserve as a bioenergy source. \\nBiopower \\nAfter hydropower, biomass is this coun-\\ntry’s second-leading resource of renewable\\nenergy, accounting for more than 7,000\\nMW of installed capacity. Some utilities\\nand power generating companies with\\ncoal power plants have found that replac-\\ning some coal with biomass is a low-cost\\noption to reduce undesirable emissions.\\nAs much as 15 percent of the coal may be\\nreplaced with biomass. Biomass has less\\nsulfur than coal. Therefore, less sulfur\\ndioxide, which contributes to acid rain, is\\nreleased into the air. Additionally, using\\nbiomass in these boilers reduces nitrous\\noxide emissions.\\nA process called gasification—the conver-\\nsion of biomass into gas, which is burned\\nin a gas turbine—is another way to gener-\\nate electricity. The decay of biomass in\\nlandfills also produces gas, mostly\\nmethane, which can be burned in a boiler\\nto produce steam for electricity generation\\nor industrial processes. Biomass can also\\nbe heated in the absence of oxygen to\\nchemically convert it into a type of fuel oil,\\ncalled pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis oil can be\\nused for power generation and as a feed-\\nstock for fuels and chemical production.  \\nBiofuels\\nBiomass can be converted directly into liq-\\nuid fuels, called biofuels. Because biofuels\\nare easy to transport and possess high\\nenergy density, they are favored to fuel\\nvehicles and sometimes stationary power\\ngeneration.

Industry has\\nalready begun to use cornstarch to pro-\\nduce commodity plastics, such as\\nshrinkwrap, plastic eating utensils, and\\neven car bumpers. Commercial develop-\\nment is underway to make thermoset\\nplastics, like electrical switch plate covers,\\nfrom wood residues. \\nGeothermal Energy\\nThe Earth’s core, 4,000 miles below the sur-\\nface, can reach temperatures of 9000° F.\\nThis heat—geothermal energy—flows out-\\nward from the core, heating the surround-\\ning area, which can form underground\\nreservoirs of hot water and steam. These\\nreservoirs can be tapped for a variety of\\nuses, such as to generate electricity or heat\\nbuildings. By using geothermal heat\\npumps (GHPs), we can even take advan-\\ntage of the shallow ground’s stable tem-\\nperature for heating and cooling buildings. \\nThe geothermal energy potential in the\\nuppermost 6 miles of the Earth’s crust\\namounts to 50,000 times the energy of all\\noil and gas resources in the world. In the\\nUnited States, most geothermal reservoirs\\nare located in the western states, Alaska,\\nand Hawaii. GHPs, however, can be used\\nalmost anywhere.  \\nGeothermal Electricity Production \\nGeothermal power plants access the under-\\nground steam or hot water from wells\\ndrilled a mile or more into the earth. The\\nsteam or hot water is piped up from the\\nwell to drive a conventional steam turbine,\\nwhich powers an electric generator. Typi-\\ncally, the water is then returned to the\\nground to recharge the reservoir and com-\\nplete the renewable energy cycle. \\nThere are three types of geothermal power\\nplants: dry steam, flash steam, and binary\\ncycle. Dry steam plants draw from reser-\\nvoirs of steam, while both flash steam and\\nbinary cycle plants draw from reservoirs\\nof hot water. Flash steam plants typically\\nuse water at temperatures greater than\\n360°F. Unlike both steam and flash plants,\\nbinary-cycle plants transfer heat from the\\nwater to what’s called a working fluid.\\nTherefore binary cycle plants can operate\\nusing water at lower temperatures of\\nabout 225° to 360°F. \\nAll of the U.S. geothermal power plants\\nare in California, Nevada, Utah, and\\nHawaii. Altogether about 2800 MW of\\ngeothermal electric capacity is produced\\nannually in this country. \\nGeothermal Direct Use\\nIf you’ve ever soaked in a natural hot spring,\\nyou’re one of millions of people around the\\nworld who has enjoyed the direct use of\\nThis gasifier in Burlinton, Vermont, converts biomass\\ninto a clean gas for electricity production\\nWarren Gretz, NREL/PIX04744\\nThe Steamboat Hills geothermal power plant\\nin Steamboat Springs, Nevada has an electric-\\nity generation capacity of 13.5 MW.\\nJoel Renner, INEEL, NREL/PIX07658\"),\n",

Direct-use applications\\nrequire geothermal temperatures between\\nabout 70° to 302°F—lower than those\\nrequired for electricity generation. The\\nUnited States already has about 1,300 geot-\\nhermal direct-use systems in operation. \\nIn a direct-use system, a well is drilled\\ninto a geothermal reservoir, which pro-\\nvides a steady stream of hot water. Some\\nsystems use the water directly, but most\\npump the water through what’s called a\\nheat exchanger.The heat exchanger keeps\\nthe water separate from a working fluid\\n(usually water or a mixture of water and\\nantifreeze), which is heated by the geot-\\nhermal water. The working fluid then\\nflows through piping, distributing the\\nheat directly for its intended use. \\nThe heated water or fluid can be used in a\\nbuilding to replace the traditional heat\\nsource—often natural gas—of a boiler, fur-\\nnace, and hot water heater. Some cities\\nand towns actually have large direct-use\\nheating systems—called district heating—\\nthat provide many buildings with heat.\\nGeothermal direct use is also used in agri-\\nculture—such as for fish farms and to heat\\ngreenhouses—and for industrial food pro-\\ncessing (vegetable dehydration).  \\nGeothermal Heat Pumps\\nWhile air temperatures can vary widely\\nthrough the seasons, the temperatures of\\nthe shallow ground only range from 50° to\\n70°F depending on latitude. GHPs draw\\non this relatively stable temperature as a\\nsource for heating buildings in the winter\\nand keeping them cool in the summer. \\nThrough underground piping, a GHP dis-\\ncharges heat from inside a building into\\nthe ground in the summer, much like a\\nrefrigerator uses electricity to keep its inte-\\nrior cool while releasing heat into your\\nkitchen. In the winter, this process is\\nreversed; the GHP extracts heat from the\\nground and releases it into a building.\\nBecause GHPs actually move heat between\\nhomes and the earth, instead of burning\\nfuels, they operate very cleanly and effi-\\nciently. In fact, GHPs are at least three times\\nmore efficient than even the most energy-\\nefficient furnaces on the market today.\\nSolar Energy\\nSolar technologies tap directly into the\\ninfinite power of the sun and use that\\nenergy to produce heat, light, and power. \\nPassive Solar Lighting and Heating \\nPeople have used the sun to heat and light\\ntheir homes for centuries. Ancient Native\\nAmericans built their dwellings directly\\ninto south-facing cliff walls because they\\nknew the sun travels low across the south-\\nern sky in the Northern Hemisphere dur-\\ning the winter. They also knew the\\nmassive rock of the cliff would absorb\\nheat in winter and protect against wind\\nand snow. At the same time, the cliff-\\ndwelling design blocked sunlight during\\nthe summer, when the sun is higher in the\\nsky, keeping their dwellings cool. \\nThe modern version of this sun-welcoming\\ndesign is called passive solar because no\\npumps, fans, or other mechanical devices\\nare used. Its most basic features include\\nlarge, south-facing windows that fill the\\nhome with natural sunlight, and dark tile\\nor brick floors that store the sun’s heat and\\nrelease it back into the home at night. In the\\nsummer, when the sun is higher in the sky,\\nwindow overhangs block direct sunlight,\\nwhich keeps the house cool. Tile and brick\\nfloors also remain cool during the summer.\\nPassive solar design combined with\\nenergy efficiency will go even further.\\nEnergy-efficient features such as energy-\\nsaving windows and appliances, along\\nwith good insulation and weatherstrip-\\nping, can make a huge difference in\\nenergy and cost savings. \\nSolar Water Heating \\nSolar energy can be used to heat water for\\nyour home or your swimming pool. Most\\nsolar water-heating systems consist of a\\nsolar collector and a water storage tank. \\nSolar water-heating systems use collectors,\\ngenerally mounted on a south-facing roof,\\nto heat either water or a heat-transfer\\nfluid, such as a nontoxic antifreeze.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/renewable.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='There are basically\\nthree types of solar\\ncollectors for heat-\\ning water: flat-\\nplate, evacuated-\\ntube, and concen-\\ntrating. The most\\ncommon type, a\\nflat-plate collector, is\\nan insulated,\\nweatherproof box\\ncontaining a dark\\nabsorber plate\\nunder a transpar-\\nent cover. Evacu-\\nated-tube collectors\\nare made up of\\nrows of parallel, transparent glass tubes.\\nEach tube consists of a glass outer tube\\nand an inner tube, or absorber, covered\\nwith a coating that absorbs solar energy\\nbut inhibits heat loss. Concentrating collec-\\ntors for residential applications are usually\\nparabolic-shaped mirrors (like a trough)\\nthat concentrate the sun’s energy on an\\nabsorber tube called a receiver that runs\\nalong the axis of the mirrored trough and\\ncontains a heat-transfer fluid.\\nAll three types of collectors heat water by\\ncirculating household water or a heat-trans-\\nfer fluid such as a nontoxic antifreeze from\\nthe collector to the water storage tanks. Col-\\nlectors do this either passively or actively. \\nPassive solar water-heating systems use\\nnatural convection or household water\\npressure to circulate water through a solar\\ncollector to a storage tank. They have no\\nelectric components that could break, a\\nfeature that generally makes them more\\nreliable, easier to maintain, and possibly\\nlonger lasting than active systems. \\nAn active system uses an electric pump to\\ncirculate water or nontoxic antifreeze\\nthrough the system. Active systems are\\nusually more expensive than passive sys-\\ntems, but they are also more efficient.\\nActive systems also can be easier to retrofit\\nthan passive systems because their storage\\ntanks do not need to be installed above or\\nclose to the collectors. Also, the moving\\nwater in the system will not freeze in cold\\nclimates. But because these systems use\\nelectricity, they will not function in a\\npower outage. That’s why many active\\nsystems are now combined with a small\\nsolar-electric panel to power the pump. \\nThe amount of hot water a solar water\\nheater produces depends on the type and\\nsize of the system, the amount of sun\\navailable at the site, proper installation,\\nand the tilt angle and orientation of the\\ncollectors. But if you’re currently using an\\nelectric water heater, solar water heating is\\na cost-effective alternative. If you own a\\nswimming pool, heating the water with\\nsolar collectors can also save you money. \\nSolar Electricity\\nSolar electricity or photovoltaic (PV) tech-\\nnology converts sunlight directly into elec-\\ntricity. Solar electricity has been a prime\\nsource of power for space vehicles since\\nthe inception of the space program. It has\\nalso been used to power small electronics\\nand rural and agricultural applications for\\nthree decades. During the last decade, a\\nstrong solar electric market has emerged\\nfor powering urban grid-connected homes\\nand buildings as a result of advances in\\nsolar technology along with global\\nchanges in electric industry restructuring. \\nAlthough many types of solar electric sys-\\ntems are available today, they all consist of\\nbasically three main items: modules that\\nconvert sunlight into electricity; inverters\\nthat convert that electricity into alternat-\\ning current so it can be used by most\\nhousehold appliances; and possibly or\\nsometimes batteries that store excess elec-\\ntricity produced by the system. The\\nremainder of the system comprises equip-\\nment such as wiring, circuit breakers, and\\nsupport structures.\\nToday’s modules can be built into glass\\nskylights and walls. Some modules resem-\\nble traditional roof shingles, but they gen-\\nerate electricity, and some come with\\nbuilt-in inverters.

And of course in remote areas, solar\\nelectricity is often a economic alternative to\\nexpensive distribution line extensions\\nincurred by a customer first connecting to\\nthe utility grid. Electricity produced by\\nsolar electric systems in remote locations is\\nstored in batteries. Batteries will usually\\nstore electricity produced by a solar-\\nelectric system for up to three days.\\nWhat type of system to purchase will\\ndepend on the energy-efficiency of your\\nhome, your home’s location, and your\\nbudget. Before you size your system, try\\nreducing energy demand through energy-\\nefficient measures. Purchasing energy-sav-\\ning appliances and lights, for example, will\\nreduce your electrical demand and allow\\nyou to purchase a smaller solar-electric\\nsystem to meet your energy needs or get\\nmore value from a larger system. Energy\\nefficiency allows you to start small and\\nthen add on as your energy needs increase. \\nSolar Thermal Electricity \\nUnlike solar-electric systems that convert\\nsunlight into electricity, solar thermal elec-\\ntric systems convert the sun’s heat into\\nelectricity. This technology is used primar-\\nily in large-scale power plants for power-\\ning cities and communities, especially in\\nthe Southwest where consistent hours of\\nsunlight are greater than other parts of the\\nUnited States.\\nConcentrating solar power (CSP) tech-\\nnologies convert solar energy into electric-\\nity by using mirrors to focus sunlight onto\\na component called a receiver. The\\nreceiver transfers the heat to a conven-\\ntional engine-generator—such as a steam\\nturbine—that generates electricity. \\nThere are three types of CSP systems:\\npower towers (central receivers), parabolic\\ntroughs, and dish/engine systems. A\\npower tower systemuses a large field of\\nmirrors to concentrate sunlight onto the\\ntop of a tower, where a receiver sits.\\nMolten salt flowing through the receiver is\\nheated by the concentrated sunlight. The\\nsalt’s heat is turned into electricity by a\\nconventional steam generator. Parabolic-\\ntrough systems concentrate the sun’s\\nenergy through long, parabolic-shaped\\nmirrors. Sunlight is focused on a pipe\\nfilled with oil that runs down the axis of\\nthe trough. When the oil gets hot, it is\\nused to boil water in a conventional steam\\ngenerator to produce electricity. A\\ndish/engine systemuses a mirrored dish\\n(similar in size to a large satellite dish).\\nThe dish-shaped surface focuses and con-\\ncentrates the sun’s heat onto a receiver at\\nthe focal point of the dish (above and cen-\\nter of the collectors). The receiver absorbs\\nthe sun’s heat and transfers it to a fluid\\nwithin an engine, where the heat causes\\nthe fluid to expand against a piston to pro-\\nduce mechanical power. The mechanical\\npower is then used to run a generator or\\nalternator to produce electricity. \\nConcentrating solar technologies can be\\nused to generate electricity for a variety of\\napplications, ranging from remote power\\nsystems as small as a few kilowatts (kW) up\\nto grid-connected applications of 200 MW\\nor more.

A hydrogen\\natom consists of only one proton and \\none electron. Despite its abundance and \\nsimplicity, it doesn’t occur naturally as a\\ngas on the Earth. \\nToday, industry produces more than 4 tril-\\nlion cubic feet of hydrogen annually. Most\\nof this hydrogen is produced through a\\nprocess called reforming, which involves\\nthe application of heat to separate hydro-\\ngen from carbon. Researchers are develop-\\ning highly efficient, advanced reformers to\\nproduce hydrogen from natural gas for\\nwhat’s called Proton Exchange Membrane\\nfuel cells.\\nYou can think of fuel cells as batteries that\\nnever lose their charge. Today, hydrogen\\nfuel cells offer tremendous potential to\\nproduce electrical power for distributed\\nenergy systems and vehicles. In the future,\\nhydrogen could join electricity as an\\nimportant “energy carrier”: storing, mov-\\ning, and delivering energy in a usable form\\nto consumers. Renewable energy sources,\\nlike the sun, can’t produce energy all the\\ntime. But hydrogen can store the renew-\\nable energy produced until it’s needed. \\nEventually, researchers would like to\\ndirectly produce hydrogen from water\\nusing solar, wind, and biomass and bio-\\nlogical technologies. \\nOcean Energy\\nThe ocean can produce two types of energy:\\nthermal energyfrom the sun’s heat, and\\nmechanical energy from the tides and waves.\\nOcean thermal energy can be used for\\nmany applications, including electricity\\ngeneration. Electricity conversion systems\\nuse either the warm surface water or boil\\nthe seawater to turn a turbine, which acti-\\nvates a generator.\\nThe electricity conversion of both tidal\\nand wave energy usually involves\\nmechanical devices. A dam is typically\\nused to convert tidal energy into electric-\\nity by forcing the water through turbines,\\nactivating a generator. Meanwhile, wave\\nenergy uses mechanical power to directly\\nactivate a generator, or to transfer to a\\nworking fluid, water, or air, which then\\ndrives a turbine/generator.\\nMost of the research and development in\\nocean energy is happening in Europe. \\nThe 6-MW Green Mountain power plant in Searsburg, \\nVermont, consists of eleven 550-kW wind turbines.\\nGreen Mountain Power Corporation, NREL/PIX05768\\nNASA uses liquid hydrogen\\nto launch its space shuttles\\nand hydrogen fuel cells to\\nprovide them with electricity\\nNASA, NREL/PIX03814'),\n",

Direct-use applications\\nrequire geothermal temperatures between\\nabout 70° to 302°F—lower than those\\nrequired for electricity generation. The\\nUnited States already has about 1,300 geot-\\nhermal direct-use systems in operation. \\nIn a direct-use system, a well is drilled\\ninto a geothermal reservoir, which pro-\\nvides a steady stream of hot water. Some\\nsystems use the water directly, but most\\npump the water through what’s called a\\nheat exchanger.The heat exchanger keeps\\nthe water separate from a working fluid\\n(usually water or a mixture of water and\\nantifreeze), which is heated by the geot-\\nhermal water. The working fluid then\\nflows through piping, distributing the\\nheat directly for its intended use. \\nThe heated water or fluid can be used in a\\nbuilding to replace the traditional heat\\nsource—often natural gas—of a boiler, fur-\\nnace, and hot water heater. Some cities\\nand towns actually have large direct-use\\nheating systems—called district heating—\\nthat provide many buildings with heat.\\nGeothermal direct use is also used in agri-\\nculture—such as for fish farms and to heat\\ngreenhouses—and for industrial food pro-\\ncessing (vegetable dehydration).  \\nGeothermal Heat Pumps\\nWhile air temperatures can vary widely\\nthrough the seasons, the temperatures of\\nthe shallow ground only range from 50° to\\n70°F depending on latitude. GHPs draw\\non this relatively stable temperature as a\\nsource for heating buildings in the winter\\nand keeping them cool in the summer. \\nThrough underground piping, a GHP dis-\\ncharges heat from inside a building into\\nthe ground in the summer, much like a\\nrefrigerator uses electricity to keep its inte-\\nrior cool while releasing heat into your\\nkitchen. In the winter, this process is\\nreversed; the GHP extracts heat from the\\nground and releases it into a building.\\nBecause GHPs actually move heat between\\nhomes and the earth, instead of burning\\nfuels, they operate very cleanly and effi-\\nciently. In fact, GHPs are at least three times\\nmore efficient than even the most energy-\\nefficient furnaces on the market today.\\nSolar Energy\\nSolar technologies tap directly into the\\ninfinite power of the sun and use that\\nenergy to produce heat, light, and power. \\nPassive Solar Lighting and Heating \\nPeople have used the sun to heat and light\\ntheir homes for centuries. Ancient Native\\nAmericans built their dwellings directly\\ninto south-facing cliff walls because they\\nknew the sun travels low across the south-\\nern sky in the Northern Hemisphere dur-\\ning the winter. They also knew the\\nmassive rock of the cliff would absorb\\nheat in winter and protect against wind\\nand snow. At the same time, the cliff-\\ndwelling design blocked sunlight during\\nthe summer, when the sun is higher in the\\nsky, keeping their dwellings cool. \\nThe modern version of this sun-welcoming\\ndesign is called passive solar because no\\npumps, fans, or other mechanical devices\\nare used. Its most basic features include\\nlarge, south-facing windows that fill the\\nhome with natural sunlight, and dark tile\\nor brick floors that store the sun’s heat and\\nrelease it back into the home at night. In the\\nsummer, when the sun is higher in the sky,\\nwindow overhangs block direct sunlight,\\nwhich keeps the house cool. Tile and brick\\nfloors also remain cool during the summer.\\nPassive solar design combined with\\nenergy efficiency will go even further.\\nEnergy-efficient features such as energy-\\nsaving windows and appliances, along\\nwith good insulation and weatherstrip-\\nping, can make a huge difference in\\nenergy and cost savings. \\nSolar Water Heating \\nSolar energy can be used to heat water for\\nyour home or your swimming pool. Most\\nsolar water-heating systems consist of a\\nsolar collector and a water storage tank. \\nSolar water-heating systems use collectors,\\ngenerally mounted on a south-facing roof,\\nto heat either water or a heat-transfer\\nfluid, such as a nontoxic antifreeze. The\\nheated water is then stored in a water tank\\nsimilar to one used in a conventional gas\\nor electric water-heating system. \\n4'),\n",

These\\nreservoirs can be tapped for a variety of\\nuses, such as to generate electricity or heat\\nbuildings. By using geothermal heat\\npumps (GHPs), we can even take advan-\\ntage of the shallow ground’s stable tem-\\nperature for heating and cooling buildings. \\nThe geothermal energy potential in the\\nuppermost 6 miles of the Earth’s crust\\namounts to 50,000 times the energy of all\\noil and gas resources in the world. In the\\nUnited States, most geothermal reservoirs\\nare located in the western states, Alaska,\\nand Hawaii. GHPs, however, can be used\\nalmost anywhere.  \\nGeothermal Electricity Production \\nGeothermal power plants access the under-\\nground steam or hot water from wells\\ndrilled a mile or more into the earth. The\\nsteam or hot water is piped up from the\\nwell to drive a conventional steam turbine,\\nwhich powers an electric generator. Typi-\\ncally, the water is then returned to the\\nground to recharge the reservoir and com-\\nplete the renewable energy cycle. \\nThere are three types of geothermal power\\nplants: dry steam, flash steam, and binary\\ncycle. Dry steam plants draw from reser-\\nvoirs of steam, while both flash steam and\\nbinary cycle plants draw from reservoirs\\nof hot water. Flash steam plants typically\\nuse water at temperatures greater than\\n360°F.
